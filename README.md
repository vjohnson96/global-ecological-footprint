# Data Analysis - Global Ecological Footprint

## Project Overview
This project consists on analysing data of the Global Ecological Footprint with Python, aiming to reach insights over this relevant theme and answer some important questions: 
- Which are the countries with the bigger ecological footprint?
- How does each global region contribute individualy?
- Is it possible to relate the countries ecologial footprint with other aspects?
To perform this analysis the following Python libraries where used: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The dataset used gathered data up to 2023 and contains 24 columns, from which 4 were extracted to develop the study.

## Why analyse the Ecological Footprint?
As the year go by, any theme regarding Earth's health gains more importance. I personally enjoy spending time in Nature, so its conservation is a theme that has my attention.
The Ecological Footprint is sustainability indicator used to understand the impact of natural resources consumption by society. In other words, it corresponds to the number of productive areas, measured in global hectares (gha), necessary to genreate all products and services for our every day necessities (source: WWF). 
In terms of numbers, as the global footprint increases, higher is the impact on the environment.
